          >Upon first few interactions, the navigation is intuitive, and
          interesting. However, with interaction over time, I found that it is
          the animated visuals that makes it interesting. However, the
          navigation experience becomes lengthy with each animation and
          transition being so consistent and takes time to happen. I found it
          slow and slightly boring if I wanted to jump between sections, as I
          had to scroll through individual sections and wait for an animation or
          transition to occur. With that in mind, I find myself using the side
          menu more often for faster navigation, as it directly leads me to the
          page I want to visit.</a
