          >I enjoyed the simplistic, left-to-right layout of the website that
          makes almost everything available at first glance, it was also
          convenient to navigate when compared to a top-to-down website, as it
          would have been time-consuming to scroll to a specific section if the
          website is lengthy, or it would require a lengthy sidebar to section
          each text for faster navigation.
