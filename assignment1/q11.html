          effective in immediately making the user engage in interacting with
          the website. The references to real-world technologies communicate a
          sense of familiarity that feels intuitive to use and engage with.

          sidebars and drop-down animations which makes the website feel clean
          and legible with minimal distractions or visuals to focus on or
          comprehend.
